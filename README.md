# Checkers

A checkers game created with the PyGame library. This game allows a human player to compete against an AI agent. We incorporated artificial intelligence by using the minimax algorithm, which demonstrates an adversarial search and performs a depth-first traversal of the game tree. Although alpha-beta pruning is often used in two player games to improve efficiency, we instead used a maximum depth of 5 during the tree traversal on each turn. This decision was made to improve efficiency while also allowing the human player to win against the AI agent in a higher proportion of games.
